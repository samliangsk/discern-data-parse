# discern-data-parse

node: NAME

## network

x packets between pair <a,b>, avg z Mbps, peak w Mbps

using <SRCIP, DSTIP> as pair to unify the records.

## file

w files changed, avg x files changed per sec or min

## logs

need to brainstorm logs due to its complexity

## cpu

cpu load avg:
cpu load max:

## considerations:

Assuming the datasourcerer are deployed on each node, and thera is a communication via the exp net, does this means the same data is stored twice, with the src and dst ip flipped? (Assuming the link is not set to random losses)

## proc

### new

creation speed, peak speed

### mem and cpu

avg consumption, Duration, peak consumption
